# GES687 Lab 6

## Bivariate Choropleth Map Showing Changes Between 2008 and 2013

## Important Notes About the File Directory
All the information about this lab is located in the GES_Lab6 folder of my Github repository. This folder contains a subfolder, two .md files, and one .rmd files. The name of the subfolder is Data because it containg the data used for the Lab. I have two .md files which are: 

Introduction: This map show the relationship between the percentage of Puerto Ricans and housing vacancies by counties in the state of Florida. It shows changes between the years 2008 and 2013. 

Data: The data will come from surveys and geografic files that are made by the U.S. Census Bureau. I would like to use data from the American Community Survey (https://www.census.gov/acs/www/data/data-tables-and-tools/data-profiles/) and the website Tiger Web (https://tigerweb.geo.census.gov/tigerwebmain/TIGERweb_main.html).

Transformations or subsets: I'm not sure if I will have to make transformations to the data. 

Analysis: I plan to create two shapefiles of the archipelago, (one representing 2010 and the other 2019), to show the changes in median income. To show the median income, I want to join two .csv files (that contain median income data from 2010 and 2019) with the shapefiles.

Outputs: I plan to create two pdf images, containing the shapefiles of Puerto Rico in 2010 and 2019. Each shapefile will have labels and a legend showing the differences in median income. This is connected to the class because I'm using geographic data and I'm applying the techniques we learned in class.
