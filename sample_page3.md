## Project 3- Linguistic Autobiography

**Project description:** This is the first page of the linguistic autobiography that I wrote for my Language, Gender, and Sexuality class. I talk about where I grew up and live currently, I talk about what attracted me to the class, and my personal experiences with language. I mention that I grew up learning Puerto Rican Spanish and U.S. American English and the things that influenced my learning: my family members, the towns I grew up in, U.S. based mass media, and the internet.  I also point out that I grew up speaking more Spanglish that my older family members.


### Making this Project

I wrote this linguistic autobiography on Microsoft Word; I used Microsoft Word from my old laptop which had a Windows 7 operating system.
