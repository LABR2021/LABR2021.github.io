## Project 1- Annotated Bibliography

**Project description:** This is one of the summaries from my annotated bibliography; I wrote it for my Language, Gender, and Sexuality class. This summary is about former liutenant governor, Lucy Flores, and how she was represented by the media when she said that President Joe Biden touched her without her consent. Although she recognized that her experience does not count as sexual assault, she thought it has important to talk about this type of behavior.  While she had support from some people (particularly women), others dismmissed and/or criticized her for saying this during the 2020 election (they accussed of helping Trump win). 

### Making this Project

I wrote this annotated bibliography on Microsoft Word; I used Microsoft Word from my old laptop which had a Windows 7 operating system.
