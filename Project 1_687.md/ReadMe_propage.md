## Differences in Median Income among Puerto Ricans

Topic: My project is about the differences in median income among Puerto Ricans who live in the archipelago. I want to know how the median income has changed in Puerto RIco between 2010 and 2019. I would like to show these differences by municipality. 

Data: The data will come from surveys and geografic files that are made by the U.S. Census Bureau. I would like to use data from the American Community Survey (https://www.census.gov/acs/www/data/data-tables-and-tools/data-profiles/) and the website Tiger Web (https://tigerweb.geo.census.gov/tigerwebmain/TIGERweb_main.html).

Transformations or subsets: I'm not sure if I will have to make transformations to the data. 

Analysis: I plan to create two shapefiles of the archipelago, (one representing 2010 and the other 2019), to show the changes in median income. To show the median income, I want to join two .csv files (that contain median income data from 2010 and 2019) with the shapefiles.

Outputs: I plan to create two pdf images, containing the shapefiles of Puerto Rico in 2010 and 2019. Each shapefile will have labels and a legend showing the differences in median income. This is connected to the class because I'm using geographic data and I'm applying the techniques we learned in class.
