## Income differences among Puerto Ricans 

My project is about income differences among Puerto Ricans who live in archipelago. I want to show income differences by municipality. I will use income data and tiger/line shapefiles from the U.S. Census Bureau to make a map showing this information. I need to covert the income data to a .csv file and then make it a part of the map.
