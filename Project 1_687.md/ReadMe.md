## Income Differences among Puerto Ricans

Topic: My project is about income differences among Puerto Ricans who live in the archipelago. I want to know how income has changed between 2010 and 2019. Then I want to show the income differences by municipality.  

Data:   

Transformations or subsets:


Analysis: I plan to create to shapefiles of the archipelago, (one representing 2010 and the other 2019), to show the changes in income. To show the income, I will join .csv files, that contain income data, to the shapefiles.
