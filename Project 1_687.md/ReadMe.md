## Differences in Median Income among Puerto Ricans

Topic: My project is about the differences in medican income among Puerto Ricans who live in the archipelago. I want to know how the median income has changed throughout the archipelago between 2010 and 2019. I would to show these differences by municipality. 

Data: The data will come from surveys and geografic files that are made by the U.S. Census Bureau. I'm thinking about using data from the American Community Survey (https://www.census.gov/acs/www/data/data-tables-and-tools/data-profiles/) and the website Tiger Web (https://tigerweb.geo.census.gov/tigerwebmain/TIGERweb_main.html).

Transformations or subsets: 


Analysis: I plan to create two shapefiles of the archipelago, (one representing 2010 and the other 2019), to show the changes in median income. To show the median income, I want to join two .csv files, that contain median income data, to the shapefiles.
