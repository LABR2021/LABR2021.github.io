## Income Differences among Puerto Ricans

My project is about income differences among Puerto Ricans who live in the archipelago. I want to know how income has changed between 2010 and 2019. Then I want to show the differences in income by municipality.  I will use numerical and geographic data provided by the U.S. Census Bureau. I plan to create to shapefiles of the archipelago, (one representing 2010 and the other 2019), to show the changes in income. To show the income, I will join .csv file with the data to the shapefiles.
