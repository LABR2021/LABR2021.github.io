## Project 2- Statistical Analysis Final Project

**Project description:** This is the introduction of my final project; I did it for the class, SOCY604- Statistical Analysis.  For this project, I did a bivariate and multivariate analysis to study the relationship between these variables: subjective class, race, and political views.  Subjective class and race were my independent variables while political views was my dependent variable.  In the introduction, I explained why it's important to study the factors that might influence political views. I also mentioned the dataset I used, the General Social Survey of 2018, and the statistical software I used, SPSS, to do my bivariate and multivariate analysis. 

### Making this Project

I wrote this final project on Microsoft Word; I used Microsoft Word from my old laptop which had a Windows 7 operating system.  In addition, I used my old laptop to download the General Social Survey 2018 dataset and SPSS.
